        <h3>500 Coffees #84 – Jessica McDonald</h3>
        <p>
          "Traditionally it seems like the only time the general public has heard of or from any executive of 
          BC Hydro has been when they’re defending an unpopular decision or they’re stepping down amid controversy. 
          She flipped this on its head when she was brought in as CEO, making herself more available and visible IRL 
          than her predecessors by doing talks and making appearances, and getting onto Twitter seems to be the evolution of that. 
          By signing up as @bchydroceo in June of 2016 she made herself accessible to everyone as well as sharing a 
          glimpse inside Hydro as a whole, and her work as its leader. I had pictured this being the work of a PR and marketing team 
          putting their heads together in a strategy room over weeks but as it turns out she simply wanted to do it, so she did." -

        <h3>Hydro provides update on Site C stress fracture</h3>
        <p>
          “BC Hydro has released an update on the situation regarding the 400 metre-long tension crack on the north bank of the Site C 
          dam site that was first revealed late last month. BC Hydro says that the stress fracture has not grown since their last 
          official update on February 24th, when the Crown Corporation broke news of the crack.” -
